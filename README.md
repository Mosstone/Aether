  Aether is a method of storing data and retrieving it as tensors
  using performant methods allowing interoperable data structures
  directly usable for machine learning, SQL, search engines, user
  storage and retrieval and shared memory maps.

  Implications include massively parallel data transfers, merging
  of scientific data between asynchronous sets, tight integration
  between machine learning data and classical computing, creation
  of immutable data structures, associative indexing of distantly
  related parameters for use in classical computing, with reduced
  reliance on ai models for data analysis in ai enhanced systems

  Aether is intended to become a core component in model training
  data creating tensors from large data sets subject to sql rules
  and viewable through layman accessible mechanisms
